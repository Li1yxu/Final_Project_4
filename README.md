The repository included a `data folder`, a `code folder`, an `output folder`, a `Makefile`, a `README.md` file and the final report `obesity_report.Rmd`.


The final report can be generated through the Make commend or knitting the obesity_report.Rmd. The contents of the report includes a description of the data set that I chose to analyze, a summary table that has descriptive statistics about the data set, and a figure analyzing of the relationship between age and BMI level.


In the`code folder`

  `00_table1_data.R`and `01_table.R`generates the table
  
  `02_figure1.R` generates the figure


In the `output folder`

  `table_data_1.rds` and `table_1.rds` stores the output of the table
  
  `figure_1.rds` stores the output of the figure
